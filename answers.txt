•  What does fast-forward in git mean? 
    Ans : Fast forward merge can be performed when there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch. In fast-forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit
•  Why should you have different branches? 
    Ans : Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.
•  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
    Ans : You can have as many remotes as you want, but you can only have one remote named "origin".
